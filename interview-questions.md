# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer:

    A function is logic code that can be reused throughout your program to save time and make your life easier.

  Researched answer:

    A function is a set of instructions for the computer to execute. It can take some (optional) inputs and adjust the data and return (optional) outputs when called on to save time when doing repetitive tasks.



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer:

    .map() iterates over every value in an array and performs some action to it. .filter() keeps any value in an array that meets a conditional.

  Researched answer:

    Both return new arrays. .map() performs a function on every value in an array and returns the new adjusted array. .filter() checks every value in an array for a true statement and filters out the false, forming a new array with the filtered values.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer:

    console.log() is only seen in the terminal or console, it's not generally visible to the user. Return is used within a function to indicate whatever input you want to give back to the user. Functions must have a return.  

  Researched answer:

    console.log() displays a parameter in the console window. When a return statement is used, a function will stop executing and return the specified value.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer:

    An argument is any data the user inputs into the function.

  Researched answer:

    Input passed to a function.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

    There are two roles. The Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is physically coding on their machine while the Navigator is guiding them through the thought process and looking up any details they may need.

  Researched answer:

    Predominantly associated with agile development, pair programming is a development technique that involves a Driver and a Navigator. The Driver writes the code and the Navigator observes and provides feedback.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer:

    No idea. Best guess would be Top Down Design? Mapping out the big picture before getting into details and features?

  Researched answer:

    Someone wasn't listening and didn't read their syllabus well enough. Surprise it was me. Test Driven Development is a development technique that prioritizes writing your test methods first before production code. TDD uses Red-Green Refactoring, meaning you want to run your test and have it fail where you're expecting it to. Then when you have your complete test, you may begin writing production code. This helps you break down larger problems into smaller more manageable steps and also helps when refactoring code, as your sure your previous code still works!



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:

    So many things!! But especially Jest. I really enjoyed having something other than console.log() to test. I also haven't been the best at pseudo coding so far and it forces you to plan out ahead of time.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React: React is a front-end, open-source JavaScript library that makes developing user interfaces easier.

- Yarn: Code is shared through packages (or modules). Yarn is a package manager for code, allowing you to use and share code all over the world.

- React State: state is an object that stores property values that belong to React components. When the state changes, the component re-renders.

- CRUD: The basic data operations any data system must perform. Create, Read, Update, Delete

- this: this is a keyword for the current object in a method. A method being a function stored inside an object.
